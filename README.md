This repository is based on Katas 9-12 [here](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/automation-centre-career-changers/tree/main)
It is copied from Amy's BasicApi project, so is named as such in the codebase.

The app contains these objects:
- Departments
- Employees, which belong to a Department
- Projects, which belong to a Department

The main files are in `src/BasicApi`. The code is split into:

## Models

Here, we define each of the 3 objects with their attributes.

## Services

Classes that define functionality for each model.

## Interfaces

Define a contract for the class - all the things that the class must provide.


### DTO (Data Transfer Objects)

To decouple the service layer from the database layer.

## Controllers

Acting as a middle layer between the Models and the Views, these handle HTTP requests.

## Migrations

These are generated by the application and tell it how to perform schema and data changes in the database. Since the project was started by running SQL commands manually, these were added primarily to allow us to run interation tests more easily.


The tests are in `tests/`. They are split into `BasicApi.Tests` (unit tests) and `BasicApi.IntegrationTests`.

The unit tests include tests for the Controllers.
These mock the Service 

The integration tests include tests for the API.
